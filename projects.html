									<h2>Project: Decode-EKG</h2>
									<p><h3>Idea Overview</h3>
									A self innovated idea to develop an AR application to assist clinical decision making. The existing EKG devices deployed in cities and villages can be reused as is but the interpretation of reports can be extended beyond cardiologist with intelligence
									on mobile phones. The application will be of great use not only to common people who would get immediate summary of their cardiac status and anomaly detection suggesting next suitable steps. but also doctors to infer, simulate and visualize the plots/ nature of waves and provide insights and draw inferences. In addition the app (or software) would also solve the issue of lack of inability to correctly detect the anomalies and severity of the condition by the technicians of the ECG diagnostic centers.
									
									<h3>Problem</h3>
									According to facts, Heart disease being the 36% of the cause of deaths, makes it top cause of death among certified deaths.
									The editorial points out the scarcity of cardiologists. In india, there are only around 4000 cardiologists while CVD is
									the leading cause of death.
									The reality is a village can have only technicians. Anyone can connect and get the graph, but very few can interpret.
									Many times the false interpretation by technicians puts an individual’s life at risk. Failing to detect the severity of
									the condition, the patient is not directed to a suitable next which costs his life.
									Article from Feb 2020 shows the severe scarcity of qualified cardiologists in India- “1700 cardiologists lose specialist
									tag after MCI order”. There are only a handful of specialized cardiologists and an appalling need to improve the quality
									and education of to-be cardiologists.
									This makes a need of Trusted second opinion is very important in real India, in tier 3 cities and below
									<h3>Solution </h3>
									The product as a whole would be an augmented reality application to read paper forms of EKGs via camera and display -
									<ul>
										<li>Heart Rate</li>
										<li>waves amplitudes P, Q, R, S, T; </li>
										<li>intervals RR, PQ, QRS, QT, QTс;</l1>
										<li>the position of the segment ST.</li>
										<li>And draw suitable conclusions with live simulation (via AR)</li>

									</ul>
		
									The end user can scan the report (ECG waves are available in the form of reports to the common people) and check for any
									cardiac anomaly. The clinically graded app will provide suitable suggestions to nearby cardiologists depending on the
									severity of the condition.
									The application can assist the technicians in the village and city with the interpretation of the reports and help them
									give better and apt decision regarding the condition of the patient
									The cardiologists can use the app ( or software) to visualize various test cases and hypothesize through the AR
									visualizations
									The registered hospital with the help of app can keep a record of the cardiac history and reports of all the patients
									The students studying cardiology can use the app for simulations, visualizations and interpretations of the report. Try
									various cases and study the heart in AR for better understanding, thus helping the quality of to-be cardiologists</p>
