											<h1>Welcome, Iâ€™m Purva Chaudhari</h1>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<p>I am an undergraduate in Computer Science deeply interested about research in the field of Particle Physics, Computational Biology, Neuroscience and Medical Health Care. I believe it is indeed a boon to be able to use your knowledge and technology to improve the quality of living and saving lives. I wish to use my calibre and contribute significantly towards the growth of AI in the field of Applied Physics, Medicine and Biology which has introduced a new dimension towards sustainability and longevity. </p>
										<p>I am seeking a career that combines my passion for technology and science with my desire to solve large, multifaceted problems.
										After my undergraduate studies, I hope to pursue a post graduation in Computer Science, particularly in Data Science and Machine Learning </p>
										<p>I am passionate about formulating and implementing creative, unique approaches to a wide range of complex questions. Computer Science has given me an incredible toolkit with which to do so and has taught me how to conceptually approach computational problems in an innovative, extensible manner. Currently, I am proficient in C, C++, Java, JavaScript,
										HTML/CSS, Python and dart, and I have also worked in R, Matlab and LaTeX. 
										I have implemented various Deep Learning architectures like VGGs, Resnets, LSTMs, RNNs, Fully Connected Neural Networks, etc. I have also implemented various Machine Learning algorithms like Regressions, KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors),Heuristic Clustering, K-Means, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.</p>
										<p>Besides my technical background, I have a keen eye for Entrepreneurship. Having closely worked with a start-up in women health care in my sophomore year helped me develop entrepreneurial qualities, leadership, team building and ability to form business model of your idea and pitching it. (Visit my extra curricular page and Achievement page to know more about my developing entrepreneurial ineterst)</p>
