									<h2>Research Thesis at INCF</h2>
									<img src="https://blog.f1000.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/INCF-Long_Logo_Pantone.jpg" width="500" height="100">
								<br>Currently I am doing my Bachelor Thesis at International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility. I am working on the project Deep Learning For Using Geometric Features under supervisors Dr Dimiter Prodanov and Sumit Vohra. 
									<h3>About project</h3>
									<p>I am Working on the Active Segmentation plugin of ImageJ. ImageJ is an OpenSource image processing tool written in Java which has been extremely helpful in the analysis of scientific images especially medical and microscopic. Active Segmentation is a plugin that aims to provide a general purpose workbench that would allow biologists to access state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning and image processing to improve their image segmentation results. It provides researchers an extensible toolbox enabling them to select custom filters and machine learning algorithms for their research.
									    During the course of my thesis, I compared three platforms i.e. Ilastik, ActiveSeg and trainable weka Segmentation in 3 metrics i.e CPU time, user time and percentage of problems in which each platform works better and improving performance of ActiveSeg. Active Segmentation is a plugin that aims to provide a general purpose workbench that would allow biologists to access state-of-the-art techniques in machine learning and image processing to improve their image segmentation results. As a part of further work I will fix the existing issues with deep learning models, support custom models and compare results with traditional techniques for at least 2 datasets.I will work in automatic generation of Roc and PR curves in ActiveSeg. The project is developed in DeepLearning4J.

								<br>Among the 51 selected students out of around 5000 applicants from all over India. It was the first chapter in India derived from the Chaincode labs. A 10 week program learning about Bitcoin architecture and contributing to bitcoin projects
									<h3>About project</h3>
									<p>I was one of the contributors to Bitcoin Core Repository under mentoring of Forbes 30 Under 30 Crypto Leader Amiti Uttarwar. I worked in the P2P domain and developed a functional test coverage for the self-advertising logic of bitcoind nodes.

								<br>Mentored by Dr David Lange and Dr Vassil Vassilev. (Sub organization: University of Princeton)
									<h3>About project</h3>
									<p>This project had the objective to reduce CMSSW technical debt by finding and replacing boost dependencies that have an equivalent solution in standard C++. Reducing boost dependencies helps us create more lightweight boost clang modules for upcoming c++20. This also reduces the amount of headers that we need to work on to be able to use c++20 clang modules.

								Project: End-to-End Deep Learning Reconstruction for CMS Experiment 
									<h3>About project</h3>
									<p>The End to End framework provides functionality to run the CMSSW inference on various deep learning models for various taggers like Electron-Photon, Quark-Gluon, Top particles and perform the task of classification (regression to come soon). The user can add .pb file of the deep learning model to the framework and run the inference to benchmark the performance. This summer I had a pleasure to be working on my project End-to-End Deep Learning Reconstruction for CMS Experiment as a part of Google Summer of Code 2021. I extended the integration framework to tau tagger, included few secondary channels like BPIX 4 and SiStrip layers — TOB, TIB, TEC, TID and benchmarked their performance.

									<h2>Project: Decode-EKG</h2>
									<p><h3>Idea Overview</h3>
									A self innovated idea to develop an AR application to assist clinical decision making. The existing EKG devices deployed in cities and villages can be reused as is but the interpretation of reports can be extended beyond cardiologist with intelligence
									on mobile phones. The application will be of great use not only to common people who would get immediate summary of their cardiac status and anomaly detection suggesting next suitable steps. but also doctors to infer, simulate and visualize the plots/ nature of waves and provide insights and draw inferences. In addition the app (or software) would also solve the issue of lack of inability to correctly detect the anomalies and severity of the condition by the technicians of the ECG diagnostic centers.
									
									<h3>Problem</h3>
									According to facts, Heart disease being the 36% of the cause of deaths, makes it top cause of death among certified deaths.
									The editorial points out the scarcity of cardiologists. In india, there are only around 4000 cardiologists while CVD is
									the leading cause of death.
									The reality is a village can have only technicians. Anyone can connect and get the graph, but very few can interpret.
									Many times the false interpretation by technicians puts an individual’s life at risk. Failing to detect the severity of
									the condition, the patient is not directed to a suitable next which costs his life.
									Article from Feb 2020 shows the severe scarcity of qualified cardiologists in India- “1700 cardiologists lose specialist
									tag after MCI order”. There are only a handful of specialized cardiologists and an appalling need to improve the quality
									and education of to-be cardiologists.
									This makes a need of Trusted second opinion is very important in real India, in tier 3 cities and below
									<h3>Solution </h3>
									The product as a whole would be an augmented reality application to read paper forms of EKGs via camera and display -
									<ul>
										<li>Heart Rate</li>
										<li>waves amplitudes P, Q, R, S, T; </li>
										<li>intervals RR, PQ, QRS, QT, QTс;</l1>
										<li>the position of the segment ST.</li>
										<li>And draw suitable conclusions with live simulation (via AR)</li>

									</ul>
		
									The end user can scan the report (ECG waves are available in the form of reports to the common people) and check for any
									cardiac anomaly. The clinically graded app will provide suitable suggestions to nearby cardiologists depending on the
									severity of the condition.
									The application can assist the technicians in the village and city with the interpretation of the reports and help them
									give better and apt decision regarding the condition of the patient
									The cardiologists can use the app ( or software) to visualize various test cases and hypothesize through the AR
									visualizations
									The registered hospital with the help of app can keep a record of the cardiac history and reports of all the patients
									The students studying cardiology can use the app for simulations, visualizations and interpretations of the report. Try
									various cases and study the heart in AR for better understanding, thus helping the quality of to-be cardiologists</p>
