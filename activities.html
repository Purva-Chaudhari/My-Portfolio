										<h3>Motivation</h3>
									I am a certified Yoga Instructor (refer my Yoga Page), and have a deep passion for Health and Wellness. It is a fact that Yoga is not a therapy or just a form of exercise; it is a way of living. Yoga and Ayurveda, one of the richest forms of our culture, are not taught in schools or colleges. It baffles me that we teach physics and chemistry, but not yoga and Ayurveda. Yoga is something which connects our body to our soul. Itâ€™s pretty surprising that we miss out on something
									that can drastically improve our lives. I believe such lifestyle values should be inculcated right from our formative learning years. The club is formed with an aim to spread and inculcate such values among youth - the torch bearers of tomorrow.<br>
									'Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'. The club initiates to	unite people and to help them unite with their body and mind.

									<h3>My Role</h3>
									<p>Being the former head of the club, I manage various activities and teams of the club and organize events to create awareness of Yoga, Health and Lifestyle among Youth. I personally take sessions in some of the club events and teach some modern Yoga flows. 
										 Along with the technical team, I also aim to develop a platform to leverage the reach of Yoga and Ayurveda (work in progress)</p>
